#2 Cleaning & Maintanance - Inspect parts for dust, wear, damage or worn parts. Take the outside case and wipe it down with a paper towel. After that you wipe it again with isopropyl alcohol on it. Take the cpu fan and wipe the frount of with a paper towel and then a second time with isopropyl alcohol on it. Also wipe the cpu with that paper towel aswell.  Then put thermal paste on the CPU if needed. The fan had dust build up do i used compressed air and wiped it clean with a paper towel. I noticed the power suplly fan was dusty too so i used the commpressed air with some short burts. You can clean the mother board with a q tip using isopropyl alcohol to get into the fine spaces if there is dust aswell.

#4 Test Boot & Troubleshooting - We are going to update and verify all components are recognized in UEFI Firmware. Open system Information, look for the system model and the name of the firmware. Copy and paste system manufactuer and the name of the motherboard into a note pad. Also the BIOS Version/date. Go into google and copy and paste the system manufactor's website.  Observe inside inventory look at the support page for recent updates that need to be made for the motherboard. Download the recent version and save it to the desktop if it isn't already. Then extract the files and drag it into a USB. Then we are going to update for recent windows update. Go to settings > Update & Security. Downlaod the missing updates and restart the computer. After that to boot into the UEFI Firmware you have to Open Settings by clicking the Start menu and selecting the gear icon. Go to Update & Security > Recovery. Under Advanced startup, click “Restart now.” The computer will reboot to a special menu. Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings.
