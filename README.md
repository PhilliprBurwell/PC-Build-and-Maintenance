#1 Disassembly - Power off and unplug the PC. Ground yourself to avoid static electricity damage using latex gloves and your static band. Carefully disassemble the side of the PC case there is a switch and slide it down to move the panel. Then your going to remove the front cover bezel and gentle remove the clips it with your finger. Then you gently remove the side panel. After that you hook your static band to the tower and then you disconnect the Sata power cables for the hard drive. Then you remove the optical drive is a piece of plastic to simply push it down and you pull it out of the socket. Once removed you can disconnect the memory. Then you're going to release the power supply's cable you can remove those clips carefully with the flathead. Then disconnect the power switch for the cable. Using the Phillip's screwdriver there will be 3 screws to disconnect the power supply. Then press the secure lock using the flat head to release the power supply. Then remove the internal speaker. The you can disconnect the fan cable. Remove the 4 screws connecting to the fan cooling the cpu with the flathead. Then remove the CPU carefully removing the clip and it comes out of the casket. Make sure everything is disconnected from the motherboard. You need to remove the 5 screws with the Phil's screwdriver starting from the bottom. Once finished with all screws you remove the rear fan. Lastly you remove the motherboard.

#2 Cleaning & Maintenance - Inspect parts for dust, damage or worn parts. Take the outside case and wipe it down with a paper towel. After that you wipe it again with isopropyl alcohol. Take the cpu fan and wipe the front of with a paper towel and then a second time with isopropyl alcohol on it. Also wipe the cpu with that paper towel as-well. You can put thermal paste on the CPU fan if needed. If your rear fan has dust build up use compressed air in short bursts and wipe it clean with a paper towel. I noticed the power supply fan had build up too so i used the compressed air. You can clean the mother board with a q tip using isopropyl alcohol to get into the fine spaces if there is dust as-well.

#3 Reassembly - First your going to install the power switch into the case. Take the motherboard and put the cpu back into its socket. Then you place the mother board back. Install the 5 screws starting from the back using your Phillips' screwdriver. Go to the front and put the power switch back to the motherboard. Install the internal speaker and connect it to the motherboard. Take the cpu fan and connect it back to the motherboard. Then screw the fan back in with the Phil's screwdriver. Then install the ram. Then start installing the power supply. Start on the back and install the 3 screws using the Phillip's screwdriver. Connect the pin and clip the wires along the inside of the PC. Use your flat head to clip the last clips. Then install the optical drive. Connect the optical drive sata power cable to the motherboard. Then the hard drive cable into the motherboard. Install the hard drive cage and connect the optical drive and sata power cable. Take your flathead and clip the cables to the optical drive. Install the front cover of the PC. Lastly install the cover panel.

#4 Test Boot & Troubleshooting - We are going to update and verify all components recognized in UEFI Firmware. Open system Information, look for the system model and the name of the firmware. Copy and paste system manufacture and the name of the motherboard into a note pad. Also the BIOS Version/date. Go into google and copy and paste the system manufacture's website.  Observe inside inventory look at the support page for recent updates that need to be made for the motherboard. Download the recent version and save it to the desktop if it isn't already. Then extract the files and drag it into a USB. Then we are going to update for recent windows update. Go to settings > Update & Security. Download the missing updates and restart the computer. After that to boot into the UEFI Firmware you have to Open Settings by clicking the Start menu and selecting the gear icon. Go to Update & Security > Recovery. Under Advanced startup, click “Restart now.” The computer will reboot to a special menu. Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings. Click UEFI firmware settings, then click Restart to change the settings in the software. We will look at settings and check for disabled interfaces. If it seems good we are going to go to POST behavior > Fastboot and press auto. Apply settings and make sure to save as customer user settings. This is to back up the settings just in case something fails. After that Press exit and the Pc will restart.
